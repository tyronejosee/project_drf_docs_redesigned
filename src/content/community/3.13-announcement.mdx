# Django REST framework 3.13

## Django 4.0 support

The latest release now fully supports Django 4.0.

Our requirements are now:

- Python 3.6+
- Django 4.0, 3.2, 3.1, 2.2 (LTS)

## Fields arguments are now keyword-only

When instantiating fields on serializers, you should always use keyword arguments,
such as `serializers.CharField(max_length=200)`. This has always been the case,
and all the examples that we have in the documentation use keyword arguments,
rather than positional arguments.

From REST framework 3.13 onwards, this is now _explicitly enforced_.

The most feasible cases where users might be accidentally omitting the keyword arguments
are likely in the composite fields, `ListField` and `DictField`. For instance...

```python
aliases = serializers.ListField(serializers.CharField())
```

They must now use the more explicit keyword argument style...

```python
aliases = serializers.ListField(child=serializers.CharField())
```

This change has been made because using positional arguments here _does not_ result in the expected behaviour.
